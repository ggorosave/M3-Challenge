# 03 Module 3 Challenge: Password Generator

## Description

This project is the third challenge from the U of A coding bootcamp. In this project, I wrote JavaScript code that will randomly generate a password for the user when they click the "Generate Password" button. In order to reach this goal, I employed variables, arrays, conditional if statements, for loops, and functions. 

This project taught me a lot about JavaScript. I learned a lot about scope and how the placement of variables in the code might cause problems. Furthermore, I have a firmer understanding of how variable placement might be beneficial and make my code easier to read. I also discovered how functions can be built and reused so my code isn't repetitive. I even used recursion on one occasion in this code.

## Credits

I used these MDN articles on [window.prompt()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt), [window.confirm()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm), and [window.alert()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert) as a reference. This YouTube video, [Var vs Const vs Let (ES6) - Beau teaches JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mgLWu69ijU), was also quite helpful.
